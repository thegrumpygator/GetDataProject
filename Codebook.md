Code Book for UCI HAR Dataset
=============================
Specifically, this is the codebook for the tidy means of the mean and standard 
deviation for each subject/activity/attempt. This codebook describes the 
variables, data, and transformations performed to clean the data.

For use with run_analysis.R
---------------------------

This file contains the descriptions of the columns/variables/measurements
in the tidy dataset created from the UCI HAR "raw" data and tidied up
via the run_analysis.R script. run_analysis.R will "print" the means
dataset to the console when run is complete. 

Several other variables will remain in the workspace environment. They are also
documented here.

Tidy "Means" Dataset
====================

For each record it is provided:
-------------------------------

- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.
- Its activity label. 
- Subject-Activity-Mean Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Subject-Activity-Mean Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 

### Rows

Each row is a summary (mean) for one attempt, for one subject, for one 
activity - a _subject-activity-attempt_.

### "Key" columns

* subjectid  
* activityname  

### "Measurement/Variable" columns

These columns contain the *means* of each parameter-measurement for each
_subject-activity-attempt_. The column labels correspond to the same labels 
from the original "raw" data, however, parentheses, dashes, underscores have
all been removed to allow easier use of R libraries such as "tidyr" and "dplyr"

The 66 measurements included in this tidy dataset are a subset of the original
561 measurements from the original "raw" data chosen such as to only include
measurement columns with "mean()" and "std()" in their original label - the
columns containing the mean and standard deviations of the measurements.
