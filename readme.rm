Readme file for run_analysis.R
==============================

Description
-----------

The run_analysis.R script reads the various files that are part of the 
UCI HAR Dataset. The Dataset folder must be in the current working directory.
The aforementioned script reads the various files and

1. Merges the test and training data into a single dataset
2. Extracts the mean and standard deviation measurements
3. Uses descriptive activity names
4. labels the variables(columns) of the dataset with appropriate names

There are 69 variables in the dataset. The first three columns are the "key"
columns providing the subject_id, activity_id, and activity_name. activity_id
and activity_name are a one-to-one lookup and would be considered redundant.
Both are included to facilitate further analysis.

The next 33 columns are the "mean" measurements. 

The last 33 columns are the "std" (standard deviation) measurements.

### Specifically, in order, the variables (columns) in the dataset are:

subject_id  
activity_id  
activity_name
