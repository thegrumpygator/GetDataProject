Readme file for run_analysis.R
==============================

Code Description
----------------

### Prerequisites
UCU HAR data must be in the working directory. 
The following packages must be installed:
* data.table
* dplyr


The run_analysis.R script reads the various files that are part of the 
UCI HAR Dataset. The Dataset folder must be in the current working directory.
The aforementioned script reads the various files and

1. Merges the test and training data into a single dataset
2. Extracts the mean and standard deviation measurements
3. Uses descriptive activity names
4. labels the variables(columns) of the dataset with appropriate names

Specifically, the more detailed steps followed are:

1. Load required R libraries
2. Setup variables to store the folder and file names to ease data loading
3. Load in the data from the test data folder
4. Load in the data from the training data folder
5. Load the files containing the feature and activity labels
6. Using the feature labels, name the columns in the feature tables (x_test)
7. Name the column in the subject_test table (subject_id)
8. Name the column in the y_test table (activity_id)
9. Glue/bind the test data (left-to-right)
10. Glue/bind the training data (left-to-right)
11. Glue/bind the test and training data (top/bottom)
12. Determine which columns/measurements to keep (mean and std)
13. Extract the kept columns from the large data table
14. Merge/Join the activity_name data into the kept data table
15. Rearrange the columns for clarity, "key/id" columns on the left.
16. Relabel the measurement columns for ease of use with dplyr, tidyr, etc.



Rationale
---------

A relatively _wide_ format was chosen for this dataset to keep each 
_subject-activity-attempt_ on a single row. (It is possible to _factor_
out the 66 measurement columns so that there would be a single measurement 
column and an additional _key_ column - measurement-name) The wide vs. 
narrow decision can be made depending on what analysis is desired.

Variable Description
--------------------

There are 69 variables in the dataset. 

The first three columns are the "key" columns providing the 
subject_id, activity_id, and activity_name. 

activity_id and activity_name are a one-to-one lookup and would be considered 
redundant. Both are included to facilitate further analysis.

The next 33 columns are the "mean" measurements. 

The last 33 columns are the "std" (standard deviation) measurements.

### Specifically, in order, the variables (columns) in the dataset are:
